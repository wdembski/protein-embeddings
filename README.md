# protein-embeddings
This code contains a package(embed_proteins) that has a method to make an embedding out of proteins. In the tutorial, you learn how to access this tool. 
We trained a recurrent neural network to be able to predict the following amino acid given a current sequence.  In doing this, the network's hidden state stores an embedding of this protein. We extract this hidden state after feeding a protein through the network and this is the embedding.
